/**
 * @public
 * @description
 * This routeMap was created to store a map of all routes within applications.
 *
 * It set routes into a Map. This map is a mapping for one path to a route configuration.
 * The path can be seen as the id of the route, and the configuration is what is actually used for the route.
 *
 * To set redirect route, just add from and to instead of path in the redirect route configuration
 *
 * Before adding a route to the map, it will test if the route exist and if it exist, it will merge the configuration.
 *
 * In non soft mode, it can throw error if the route already contain the component or is changing it's name within it's route configuration
 *
 * > We use core-js/es6/map and core-js/fn/symbol/for for old browsers that does not support Map, see https://www.npmjs.com/package/core-js for more information.
 *
 *
 * @param {array} routesConfig - A list of routes configuration object that will be flatten and set in the map
 * @param {Map} [routesMap=new Map()] - An optional existing routeMap
 * @param {object} [options={ soft: false, childKey: 'routes' }] - Options to configure getRoutesMap,
 * if options.soft is true, it will skip all errors found during the merge,
 * if options.soft is false, it will throw error if a route already:
 *   - have a component and a second is found
 *   - have a name and different name is found
 *
 * @return {Map<string, object>} - The routeMap object used for your application

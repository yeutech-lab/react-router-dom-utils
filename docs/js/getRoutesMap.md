## getRoutesMap

This routeMap was created to store a map of all routes within applications.

It set routes into a Map. This map is a mapping for one path to a route configuration.
The path can be seen as the id of the route, and the configuration is what is actually used for the route.

To set redirect route, just add from and to instead of path in the redirect route configuration

Before adding a route to the map, it will test if the route exist and if it exist, it will merge the configuration.

In non soft mode, it can throw error if the route already contain the component or is changing it's name within it's route configuration

> For old browsers that does not support Map, use a polyfill in your application: [https://www.npmjs.com/package/core-js][1]

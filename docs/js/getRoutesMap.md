## getRoutesMap

This routeMap was created to store a map of all routes within applications.

It set routes into a RoutesMap. This map one path to a route configuration.

RoutesMap class extends from Map and has a modified get method that permit to get using `/users/1` and get `/users/:id`

The path can be seen as the id of the route, and the configuration is what is actually used for the route.

To set redirect route, just add from and to instead of path in the redirect route configuration

Before adding a route to the map, it will test if the route exist and if it exist, it will merge the configuration.

In non soft mode, it can throw error if the route already contain the component or is changing it's name within it's route configuration

> We use core-js/es6/map and core-js/fn/symbol/for for old browsers that does not support Map, see [https://www.npmjs.com/package/core-js][1] for more information.

### Parameters

-   `routesConfig` **[array][2]** A list of routes configuration object that will be flatten and set in the map
-   `routesMap` **[RoutesMap][3]** An optional existing routeMap (optional, default `newRoutesMap()`)
-   `options` **[object][4]** Options to configure getRoutesMap,
    if options.soft is true, it will skip all errors found during the merge,
    if options.soft is false, it will throw error if a route already:-   have a component and a second is found
    -   have a name and different name is found (optional, default `{soft:false,childKey:'routes'}`)

Returns **[RoutesMap][3]&lt;[string][5], [object][4]>** The routeMap object used for your application

## RoutesMap

RoutesMap class extend Map class and has an edited get method to retrieve route from parameterized path.

const routesMap = new RoutesMap([
 ['/', { name: 'Home' }],
 ['/users/:id', { name: 'EditUser' }],
]);
// get as usual (See https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Objets_globaux/Map/get)
const home = routesMap.get('/');
// get as usual
const editUser = routesMap.get('/users/:id');
// this should not work
const editUser = routesMap.get('/users/1');
// now it work
